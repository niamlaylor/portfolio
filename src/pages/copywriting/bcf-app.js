              <p>The original website had an out-of-date design that was a pain to use on a mobile device, so our strategy was to create a crisp and concise layout with a mobile-first, responsive layout. The new website launched in the fall of 2020 and has processed revenues in the billions since.</p>

              <p className="mt-6 mb-2">For years, BC Ferries was known for its rigid tone when communicating with customers. As a copywriter leading content development on the new website, my role was to champion a more human and relatable voice and tone company-wide, and ensure consistency across all of our digital touchpoints.</p>
              <p>BC Ferries is also known for having highly complex business rules and operational procedures. My biggest challenge on this project was fully understanding these complexities and translating it into clear and concise content for our B2C and B2B customer base. My approach was to break down complicated procedures into simple, easy-to-understand steps. This resulted in a more accessible and user-friendly website that resonates with BC Ferries' diverse customer base.</p>
